# FMTK Contributing Guidelines

We want to make contributing to this project as easy as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features

## Propose Changes

[Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

Steps:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Report Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/widberg/fmtk/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce
  * Be specific!
  * Give sample code if you can
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Coding Style

* As long as there is some attempt at consistency we should be fine.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/widberg/fmtk/blob/master/LICENSE).
